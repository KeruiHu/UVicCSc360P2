Design Document: 
In this project,  the number of threads is equal to the number of trains. And every thread is independent. I use two mutex, one is the queue mutex and another one is track mutex. The main thread is idle. First of all, I read the input file and create threads. Secondly, I will firstly let every train finish loading first, and lock the queue mutex to let the train add to the waiting queue. The queue is a linked list, and the addToQueue function followed by the scheduling rules, therefore the queue can always in order.  Once the queue has one train, then this train is allowed to cross track with track mutex locked. After travelling, this trainNode will be free and the queueRoot will move to the next node.
